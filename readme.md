## Shit.ly
Shit.ly is a small URL shortener project that came up as an outcome of HackNight. It's built on Laravel 4.2.7 

### Things it can do
It's made up in few hours but still it has the following mind boggling earth-shattering features. :P
* Basic shortening and validation
* Proper redirection to 404 pages if tried to cheat.
* Decent UI. Suitable to the project name. ;)

### Installation : 
* Download Laravel 4.x and install it as specified here - http://laravel.com/docs/installation#install-laravel
* Run the default composer installation to get the vendors.
* Clone the shit.ly repository and merge it.

### Configuration:
* Go to `/app/config/database.php` 
* Set the driver as `mysql` and provide the database credentials. The preferred database name is `db_shitly`. If you want to change that, go to `/db_shitly.sql` and change the database to anything you like.

Alrighty! You are done!
